### Search Term Intent Verification SOP: Search Intent Classification Overview

#### Overview of Search Intent Categories

Search intent—also known as user intent—refers to the purpose behind a user’s search query and is essential for high-quality SEO and user-centric information architecture. Based on key sources, intent types generally map to the following categories, closely aligning with your outlined SOP:

-  
  **Direct Service Need (Exact Service Intent):**
  - User is explicitly seeking a particular service or professional.
  - Example: “tooth cleaning,” “divorce lawyers,” “solar panel installers”.

-  
  **Price/Cost Focus (Cost/Price-Sensitive Intent):**
  - Queries contain service keywords combined with words like "cost," "price," or "how much," showing sensitivity to expense.
  - Example: “window repair cost,” “glazier price near me”.

-  
  **Location Indicator (Location-Specific Intent):**
  - Query includes a service, someone who does it, and any location reference (city, postcode, borough, etc.).
  - Example: “carpet cleaner London,” “joiner SE1”.

-  
  **Competitor/Brand Match (Competitor or Brand-Name Search):**
  - Includes explicit brand names or terms associated with specific companies.
  - Example: “glazing squad,” “Just Eat alternatives”.

-  
  **Clearly Irrelevant/Job/DIY (Irrelevant or Negative Intent):**
  - Search terms are unrelated, reference jobs, or indicate DIY.
  - Example: “glazing jobs,” “how to install double glazing yourself”.

-  
  **Informational or Research-Based (Informational or Research-Based Intent):**
  - User wants to learn or research, but not necessarily to buy or hire.
  - Example: “back pain,” “causes of condensation on windows”.

-  
  **Question Phrasing (Question-Form Queries):**
  - Direct questions or queries that are question-like.
  - Example: “What is a glazier?” “How do I fix a broken pane?”.

-  
  **Personal Name Focus (Personal Name/Surname Intent):**
  - Queries contain individual names or surnames, typically seeking a specific person.
  - Example: “Vishal Cook physio,” “Dr. Sarah Patel dentist”.

-  
  **Non-English (Non-English or Multilingual Queries):**
  - Queries in languages other than English or containing foreign words/numbers.
  - Example: “dentista Madrid,” “歯科 医 院”.

-  
  **Generic/Unclear (Vague/Ambiguous Intent):**
  - Very broad, generic, or single-word terms that are not clearly tied to a specific service or need.
  - Example: “pain,” “health,” “teeth”.

-  
  **Closely Related Service (Similar Service/Related Intent):**
  - Reference to services closely adjacent or related to the core service advertised.
  - Example: “joiners near me” (when advertising glazing).

#### Important Context from Industry Sources

-  
  Google and leading SEO platforms often aggregate intent into Informational, Navigational, Transactional, and Commercial categories.
-  
  Real-world intent frequently overlaps (e.g., a user might incorporate cost and location in one query).
-  
  Emerging approaches recommend finer-grained classifications (such as separating Answer vs. Research intent), which lines up with your outlined combinations.
-  
  Contextual details like time, place, and user device can further refine intent assessment.

#### Application

-  
  Each search term should be reviewed and assigned to **one** category based on the dominant intent, preserving duplicates.
-  
  Use signals (keywords, structure, context) per category as described above.
-  
  Do not guess or change the original intent—parse and classify only.
